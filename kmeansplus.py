def k_init(X, n_clusters, x_squared_norms, random_state, n_local_trials=None):
    """Init n_clusters seeds according to k-means++
    Parameters
    ----------
    X : array or sparse matrix, shape (n_samples, n_features)
        The data to pick seeds for. To avoid memory copy, the input data
        should be double precision (dtype=np.float64).
    n_clusters : integer
        The number of seeds to choose
    x_squared_norms : array, shape (n_samples,)
        Squared Euclidean norm of each data point.
    random_state : int, RandomState instance
        The generator used to initialize the centers. Use an int to make the
        randomness deterministic.
        See :term:`Glossary <random_state>`.
    n_local_trials : integer, optional
        The number of seeding trials for each center (except the first),
        of which the one reducing inertia the most is greedily chosen.
        Set to None to make the number of trials depend logarithmically
        on the number of seeds (2+log(k)); this is the default.
